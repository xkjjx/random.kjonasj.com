        <h1>Digit Recognition Project</h1>

        <section class="project-intro">
            <p>I started this project to explore the practical aspects of ML training. I have built a decent foundation on neural networks from the many wonderful content available on YouTube, but I did not have any background into implementing them.</p>

            <p>I started out with the basic densely connected neural network, and then moved on to using a CNN. Finally, I improved tweaked some aspects of the CNN to achieve the best model possible.</p>

            <p>I also explored the many ways researchers play around and train their model. The project was built primarily using <a href="https://github.com/xkjjx/basic-digit-recognition">python scripts</a>. However, I wanted to get a feel for how python notebooks are used. I have no experience using them and they are quite popular in ML communities. Thus, for the last training, I took elements of my script and put it in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevinjonas/cnnv2/edit">kaggle</a> and trained it there.</p>

            <p>The models are showcased here as fully static files. I was even able to create a demo page fully statically, where one can upload any model and play around with its predictions.</p>

            <p>This is hosted fully on Github pages.</p>
